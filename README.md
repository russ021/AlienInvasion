# AlienInvasion

This is a game project from Python Crash Course 2nd edition by Eric Matthes.
To run this game in it's current state, you need python installed, as well as pygame.
You can install pygame with the python package helper pip.
Then just run alien_invasition.py and the game should load.

Press start to start or play agian. Press spacebar to fire bullets and right/left arrows to move.
The game will end when you die three times.
This game is almost complete just need to add score board and number of ships left.
Also I have to add higher levels to play once you shoot all aliens in each level.
